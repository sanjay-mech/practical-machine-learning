# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python
Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms in Python repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of machine learning.


Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field with a wide range of algorithms that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This project focuses on implementing popular machine learning algorithms in Python, providing a foundation for understanding and applying these techniques to real-world problems.

The main goal of this project is to offer a central repository that houses various machine learning algorithms, making them easily accessible and facilitating experimentation and exploration. Each algorithm is implemented using Python, with clear documentation and explanations to enhance understanding. By exploring the algorithms in this repository, users can deepen their knowledge of machine learning concepts and gain practical experience in implementing and applying these algorithms.

Algorithms
This repository includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Each algorithm is contained within its own Jupyter Notebook, providing a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's theory, implementation details, and example use cases. The notebooks are organized in a logical manner, making it easy to navigate and explore the algorithms of interest
